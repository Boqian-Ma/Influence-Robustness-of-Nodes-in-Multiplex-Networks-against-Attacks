Network robustness of multiplex networks with interlayer degree correlations

For example, for maximallycorrelated duplex networks, all pairs of nodes in the giant component are connected via at least two
independent paths and network structure is highly resilient to random failure

In contrast, anticorrelated duplex networks are on one hand robust against targeted attack on high-degree nodes,
but on the other hand they can be vulnerable to random failure.
